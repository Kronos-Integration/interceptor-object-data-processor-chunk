== Object chunk data processor
This processor is for validating and checking data as it comes from data imports as file imports or database imports.
This processor is for data imports where the whole content needs to be validated. For example it needs to be proofed
that a key field only exists once in the deliverd data. Or where rows needs to be aggregated because the data
contains 1..n relations.

The config defines how the data is structured and what to do. The processor will ensure that the data is valid. All
errors will be reported.
